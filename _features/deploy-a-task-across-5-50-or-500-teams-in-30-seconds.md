\#team task app to help you eliminate internal email. You can publish a task across 5, 50 or 500 teams in less than 30 seconds.

For example, imagine you want 300 of your teams to be aware of a marketing campaign and there is something that requires their action by 4pm Thursday.

Whatever you do, don’t send an email! You may receive 180 replies to your inbox, then you still have to manually figure out who has done what, who hasn’t and who has a question.

With #team, you can assign the right teams to the right tasks in seconds, then instantly see in real-time what teams are up to date as the deadline approaches.

You can then manage by exception, saving everyone time.
