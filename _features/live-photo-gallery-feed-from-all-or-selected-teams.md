\#team's task app has a live photo gallery feed of the task types and teams you are interested in.

For example, imagine you work at head office in visual merchandising and you are responsible for all retail outlets in Chicago.  You need to see that each day the point of sale and other in-store visual merchandising promotions are correctly displayed across 45 stores.

You can save that selection as your default, and #team will give you a live data feed of:

* VM related tasks done or missed by your selection of teams
* Live photo gallery feed of tasks that have photos

These even run as screensaver, so you can project them onto a large screen monitor for your whole team at head office to see in open plan work areas.
