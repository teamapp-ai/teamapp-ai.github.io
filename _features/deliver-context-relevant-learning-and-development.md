\#team changes the game for L&D on three fronts.

1\. You can deploy L&D content to precisely the point when employees really need it - for the things they are about to do right now. You can even set that L&D content to must-be-viewed before certain initiatives can be done.

2\. You can objectively allocate your L&D spend based on actual live data. For example: What is getting done? What is being missed? What is the quality? How does this compare across team types, locations and managers?

3\. It is much easier and more cost effective to train someone into a role when their whole day/ week/ fortnight/ month of how-to information is already laid out in front of them. People can join the team and immediately contribute to what needs to be done next.
