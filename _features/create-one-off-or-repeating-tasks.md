\#team allows you to manage both one-off and repeating tasks across one or multiple teams.

## one-off tasks

\#team is brilliant for managing one-off tasks across **multiple teams**.

We don't recommend using team for one-off tasks on one team.  There are plenty of task apps designed specifically for this.

## repeating tasks

\#team is brilliant for managing repeating tasks across **one team** or **multiple teams**.

Every team in your organization has repeating tasks.

Moving the management of repeating tasks out of calendar apps, spreadsheets and paper checklists will give you all of these benefits:

\#team really comes into its own when managing repeating tasks across multiple teams/ sites/ stores.  #team is the best task app in the world right now for managing repeating tasks across multiple teams, due to:

* Easy of use
* Speed of use
* Team-shared UX encouraging teamwork
* Dashboards, result tables and photo galleries
* Powerful filters, including default saving of filters for every individual manager and executive to focus on exactly the aspects they are interested in
