\#team's task app allows you to define which teams can see their performance relative to other teams.

For example, you might like all teams in California to see their performance relative to each other, but you don't need them comparing themselves to Texas or Illinois.

Creating healthy competition, with a positive context, is far more effective than top-down control. 

Teams develop a natural sense of pride and team leaders will soon start reaching out to each other to collaborate on what works and what doesn't.  Encouraging this style of collaboration builds culture and sustainable performance.
