\#team's task app has default filters so you can manage the tasks and teams you are interested in.

This capability is custom to every individual leader, manager and executive on the Management App.  Note, the Management App is free for unlimited users.

Each person with access to the Management App can save default filters to narrow down dashboards, results and live photo galleries by the task types, teams, geographies and brands they are responsible for.
