    open time, same great coffee, always fully stocked shelves, cleaned areas, lunch
    specials prepped and ready plus plenty of change in the till. All without any
    hiccups. "

  title: Critical tasks
  text: "Critical Tasks need to get done or nothing else can. The common sense one’s
    that sometimes get overlooked and then translate to last minute panics and half
    measures that make you look like you don’t know what you’re doing.\n\nAn app that
    alerts your staff that something critical needs to get done, without you having
    to micro manage it and staff feeling ‘heckled’ by their boss. \n\nYou can rest
    easy knowing your business works without you and your staff feel they can be trusted
    to get it right.  \n"

  text: "Did it get done to your standard? More than just ensuring brand consistency
    or that displays look right. Sometimes there’s a serious ramifications to not
    having tasks done to the right way . As an owner or frontline manager you need
    to ensure standards are being maintained and meet legislative codes. \n\nTasks
    that involve Occupational Health and Safety, HR compliance, Cleanliness Procedures
    and more need proof that it was done right. It’s also a great measure to protect
    your staff should any contention or doubts arise. \n\n#team’s verification on
    tasks feature ensures that not only are you ahead of any competition with consistency
    but you’re also 100% compliant to codes.\n\n"
