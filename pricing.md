faqs:
- question: How long is the free trial?
  answer: "The free trial is 21 days, but you'll be up and running within 2 cups of
    coffee!\n\n\\#team works beautifully for just one team, or hundreds of teams.\n\nClients
    usually take:  \n\\- 1 day to configure and publish tasks to teams  \n\\- 5 days
    to test with their first 2-3 teams, to refine the content  \n\\- every 5 days
    to rollout to batches of teams at a time\n\nThere are no set-up fees. No consultants,
    integration or hardware costs.\n\nYou can rollout team with minimal to no end
    user training."
- question: How does annual billing work?  What is the currency and contract term?
  answer: "You can choose from monthly or annual billing, payable in advance.  Annual
    pricing is discounted 17-22% on monthly pricing.\n\nPricing shown above is US$.\n\nThere
    is no contract term beyond the billing cycle. \n\nOn annual billing, your active
    teams are billed annually in advance. As you activate more teams in #team, these
    are billed pro-rata for the balance of the year, so you can easily manage all
    of your teams to one annual billing cycle.\n\nDeactivated teams automatically
    credit against future teams you activate.\n\nYou can manage more than one organization
    under the same account, with different billing and payment methods per organization.
    You can run more than one brand per organization."
- question: What payment methods do you accept?
  answer: |-
    We accept all major credit and debit cards, including American Express, Visa, Mastercard and Diners Club.

    Payments are securely processed through the reputable Stripe payment gateway. Our billing engine runs on the secure Chargebee platform, which provides you with a client portal to access your subscription status, payment methods, billing information, payment history and invoices.
- question: How do we access billing and past invoices?
  answer: Our billing engine runs on the secure Chargebee platform, which provides
    you with a private client portal to access your subscription status, payment methods,
    billing information, payment history and invoices.
- question: What languages can I use to publish tasks to teams?
  answer: "Most languages are supported, including the search and log features within
    #team. \n\nNavigation menus are minimal and in English."
- question: 'As a small business, how should I get started with #team? '
  answer: "You may like to start with just 3 teams. \n\n1 team that includes everyone.
    \n\n1 team for customer facing roles. \n\n1 team for administration and finance.
    \n\nFirst start with the key daily/ weekly/ fortnightly/ monthly recurring functions
    of each of these 3 teams. Keep it simple, then add more content as the teams get
    comfortable.\n\nGo live within a couple of hours."
- question: 'How should we implement #team across 2,000 teams/ sites/ stores?  '
  answer: "First think about how to make this a game changer for your business - whether
    that's elevating performance, being more agile or doing more with less.\n\nDon't
    get bogged down upfront on what systems this will replace, as you will learn a
    lot more about that as you go and this exploratory journey of step-change innovation
    will only cost a few hundred dollars, not $100,000.\n\nStart with 10-12 teams
    under 2 good managers, 5-6 teams each. \n\nRun a 3 week trial, experimenting with
    the content and listening to feedback at all levels. \n\nTake 5-7 raw authentic
    quick iPhone video interviews with staff, team leaders and managers - as these
    will be invaluable later for communicating to all leaders and managers. \n\nEvaluate
    the trial, update the content then roll out progressively one state or country
    at a time."
- question: Is our data safe?
  answer: |-
    Yes! We use the latest in encryption and authentication technology.

    Data is encoded in each organization, only available to that organization and its users. Data hosting is with Linode, which we found to provide the fastest end user experience.
- question: "â€‹For how long is past data accessible? "
  answer: "At this time you can access all past data on active and inactive teams.
    So that our data costs don't blowout, on a future release we will change this
    to 3 years where 80% of teams are active, otherwise 1 year. \n\nBefore making
    that change we will communicate to all clients and of course we will put in place
    sufficient admin user notifications to make this threshold easy to manage on an
    ongoing basis."
- question: 'What happens when I stop using #team?'
  answer: No problem, there are no termination fees. Before deactivating your account
    you may like to download your data from the Management Console's results and logs
    pages. On future releases we will be creating APIs for you to link your task app
    data to BI/data analytics tools.
