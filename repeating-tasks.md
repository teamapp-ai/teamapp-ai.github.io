    When email was first invented it consumed about 5% of our time and a reasonable response time was 7 days.

    Email and messaging apps are now a real time medium, consuming 40% of our time, with another 45-55% lost to meetings, routine tasks and being reactive.

    Executives, managers and team leaders are fast losing the headspace to think deeply, plan carefully, experiment freely and flawlessly execute on strategy execution, new capabilities and change.
