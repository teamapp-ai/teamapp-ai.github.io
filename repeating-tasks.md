    #team is the world's first task app designed around a team-shared user experience, which encourages teamwork and is faster for teams.

    Each team can see a live burndown chart of tasks completed versus remaining and time. Teams can compare their performance with other teams you nominate. For example, I want this team to see their performance relative to all teams in Chicago.

    Team Leaders can easily see the exact status of performance and what needs a focus as they take over a shift.

## **repeating tasks**

There are several excellent app options for collaboration or managing projects such as [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Asana](https://asana.com/) or [Monday](https://monday.com/) and [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/)**.**

But what about repeating tasks across one or multiple teams.  The things that occur in your business that you want to track daily/ weekly/ fortnightly/ monthly/ quarterly/ annually.

This is where #team excels.  Multiple teams executing consistently and with more visibility than you've ever hard before.

You can't manage what you don't measure. #team produces live and actionable intelligence  in a meaningful format for all levels.

## **one-off tasks**

Of course #team handles one-off tasks. Imagine you want 300 of your teams to be aware of a marketing campaign and there is something that requires their action by 4pm Thursday.

Whatever you do, don't send an email! You may receive 180 replies to your inbox, then you still have to manually figure out who has done what, who hasn't and who has a question.

With #team, you can assign the right teams to the right tasks in seconds, then instantly see in real-time what teams are up to date by the deadline.

Or you can go one better. Set yourself a custom alert so you can proactively manage by exception, for example: "Alert me if more than 10% of my teams have not completed the initiative by 3:30pm Thursday."

## **culture & cadence**

Use #team to create the rhythm and cadence you are aiming to achieve across your teams.

When do you want certain things done? When do you want the team focused and not interrupted?

People matter. Small things matter. Team morale and culture decline if things start to get missed or "forgotten". 

Regularly missing even routine things negatively impacts overall team culture and performance if left unchecked.

With #team, you don't need to be there in person to see what is happening and what isn't.

## **learning & development**

\#team changes the game here on three fronts.

1\. You can deploy L&D content to precisely the point when employees really need it - for the things they are about to do right now. You can even set that L&D content to must-be-viewed before certain initiatives can be done.

2\. You can objectively allocate your L&D spend based on actual live data. For example: What is getting done? What is being missed? What is the quality? How does this compare across team types, locations and managers?

3\. It is much easier and more cost effective to train someone into a role when their whole day/ week/ fortnight/ month of how-to information is already laid out in front of them. People can join the team and immediately contribute to what needs to be done next.

## **actionable intelligence**

Let's consider 50 teams that average 20 tasks that you want to measure per day across customer service, operations, OH&S, administration and finance.

That equals **1,000 tasks per day, 365,000 per year and in 3 years that's a huge 1.1 million** tasks that you have said are important for the business and your teams to focus on.

But that's just the beginning. Can you imagine the power of overlaying these performance insights against data from sales, customer experience, resourcing and employee satisfaction?

Not only can you run the business better with actionable intelligence, you can elevate the performance of every team whilst de-risking the business and increasing its value.

## **artificial intelligence**

There are many ways AI can make our clients' lives easier.

We are developing AI features to proactively assist clients in decision making and elevating the team performance.

In the meantime, having a live photo gallery that can be quickly filtered by the tasks, teams and locations each manager is interested in, is significantly better than using email or having your cluster or area managers physically driving to physically inspect.

## **millennials**

Millennials (Gen Y) grew up in the internet age and apart from 'getting' the tech in less than 60 seconds, millennial team members and team leaders have a natural preference for transparency that makes collaboration and teamwork so much easier. 

Gen Z were born into a highly sophisticated media and computer environment and are even more tech savvy and expert than their Gen Y forerunners.

However they both share a culture of self sufficiency and the prevailing attitude we've experienced with #team is:

"_I don't mind visibility of my performance. I just want the expectations on me to be clear. #team does that for me, and the whole team, so we can just get on with the job"._
