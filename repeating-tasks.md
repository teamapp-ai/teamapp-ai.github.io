    Traditionally the board or CEO would formulate a strategy, then communicate it in two static documents - one describing the strategy, the other setting targets. Some companies do this as annual offsite events or roadshows. Some hire consultants. Some invite middle management. Some invite the whole company.

    Regardless of the approach, two things fail:

    1. **urgent overtakes important** - people donâ€™t have the skill, will or time to focus on strategy execution, as day to day priorities consume everyone
    2. **fast out of date** - whilst the strategy sounded great, within a few weeks or months it no longer matches what the organization needs to focus on

    When email was first invented it consumed about 5% of our time and a reasonable response time was 7 days.

    Email and messaging apps are now a real time medium, consuming 40% of our time, with another 45-55% lost to meetings, routine tasks and being reactive.

    Executives, managers and team leaders are fast losing the headspace to think deeply, plan carefully, experiment freely and flawlessly execute on strategy execution, new capabilities and change.
