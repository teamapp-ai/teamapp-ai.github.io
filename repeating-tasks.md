    #team is the world's first task app designed around a team-shared user experience. This encourages teamwork and is faster for teams, because 95% of tasks can be done by anyone in a team.  You still capture the data of who completed what when.

    Each team can see a live burndown chart of their tasks completed versus remaining tasks and time. Teams can compare their performance with other teams you nominate. For example, I want this team to see their performance relative to all teams in Chicago.

    Team Leaders can easily see what they need to focus on as they take over a shift, and in seconds they can see what's been done on time, late or missed.

## **repeating tasks - 1 or multiple teams**

There are several excellent options for work collaboration or managing projects, such as [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Asana](https://asana.com/), [Monday](https://monday.com/) and [Wrike](https://www.wrike.com/)**.**

**#team is the best task app for managing repeating tasks across one or multiple teams.**  Things you want to track daily/ weekly/ fortnightly/ monthly/ quarterly/ annually.

With #team you will have multiple teams executing consistently and with more visibility than ever before.

You can't manage what you don't measure. #team produces live and actionable intelligence, in a meaningful format, for each level of the organization.

## **one-off tasks - multiple teams**

\#team also handles one-off tasks, in a powerful way when applied across multiple teams.

For example, imagine you want 300 of your teams to be aware of a marketing campaign and there is something that requires their action by 4pm Thursday.

Whatever you do, don't send an email! You may receive 180 replies to your inbox, then you still have to manually figure out who has done what, who hasn't and who has a question.

With #team, you can assign the right teams to the right tasks in seconds, then instantly see in real-time what teams are up to date as the deadline approaches.

You can then manage by exception, saving everyone time.

## **culture & cadence**

Use #team to create the rhythm and cadence you are aiming to achieve across your teams.

When do you want certain things done? When do you want the team focused and not interrupted?

The little things do matter. Team morale, culture and customer experience decline if things start to get missed or "forgotten".

With #team, you don't need to be there in person to see what is happening and what isn't.

## **learning & development**

\#team changes the game for L&D on three fronts.

1\. You can deploy L&D content to precisely the point when employees really need it - for the things they are about to do right now. You can even set that L&D content to must-be-viewed before certain initiatives can be done.

2\. You can objectively allocate your L&D spend based on actual live data. For example: What is getting done? What is being missed? What is the quality? How does this compare across team types, locations and managers?

3\. It is much easier and more cost effective to train someone into a role when their whole day/ week/ fortnight/ month of how-to information is already laid out in front of them. People can join the team and immediately contribute to what needs to be done next.

## **actionable intelligence**

Let say you have 50 teams that average 20 tasks per day across customer service, operations, OH&S, administration and finance.

That is **1,000** tasks per day, **365,000** tasks per year.  In 3 years that's **1.1 million** tasks.

But that's just the beginning.  Can you imagine the power of overlaying these performance insights against data from sales, customer experience, resourcing and employee satisfaction?

Not only can you run the business better with actionable intelligence, you can elevate the performance of every team whilst derisking the business and increasing its value.

## **artificial intelligence**

There are many ways AI can make our clients' lives easier.

\#team are developing AI features to proactively assist clients in decision making and elevating the team performance.

In the meantime, having a live photo gallery that can be quickly filtered by the tasks, teams and locations each manager is interested in, is significantly better than using email or having your cluster or area managers physically drive to a site to inspect.

## **millennials**

Millennials (Gen Y) grew up in the internet age and apart from 'getting' the tech in less than 60 seconds, millennial team members and team leaders have a natural preference for transparency that makes collaboration and teamwork so much easier.

Gen Z were born into a highly sophisticated media and computer environment and are even more tech savvy and expert than their Gen Y forerunners.

However they both share a culture of self sufficiency and the prevailing attitude we've experienced with #team is:

"_I don't mind visibility of my performance. I just want the expectations on me to be clear. #team does that for me, and the whole team, so we can just get on with the job"._
