\#team is designed for speed and teamwork.

You can accelerate that by using a verb-noun construct for task wording.

Examples of verb-noun construct:

* Set the music per attached schedule
* Check the customer areas per checklist below
* Take a photo of the visual merchandising displays at point of sale
* Count the number of oversized items

The verb-noun construct is the fastest way for teams to interpret tasks without confusion.  This natural style of communication goes back to our childhood: "wash your hair", "make your bed" and "clean the car".

The application of verb-noun to task management was perfected in the early 90's with the reengineering and process mapping methodologies introduced by Hammer & Champy, and before that the activity-based-costing thinking pioneered by Kaplan.
