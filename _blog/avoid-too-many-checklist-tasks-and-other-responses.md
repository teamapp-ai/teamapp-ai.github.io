We've noticed team leaders, managers and executives get very excited once they understand the content page on the Management App - the page for assigning tasks to teams.

We've noticed this excitement can sometimes be applied in a way that works against the productivity of frontline teams.

For the best results, we recommend:

1. **start with critical tasks** - even if you envisage running 150 tasks per day per team, start with the 10-15 critical tasks
2. **minimize responses** - only request photos and other responses per task that you really need, so the team feel that each request is worthy
3. **minimize checklists** - if a task requires more than 6 checklist items, split the task into 2 or more tasks

With respect to 2) and 3) above, you will notice the Team App is designed for fast teamwork.  Simple tasks on the Team App take only a few seconds to mark off as completed.  Your teams will like that, and the instant gratification of how the task completes and the dashboards change.

With this in mind, you are better off creating a higher number of tasks per team, than making individual tasks more complicated to complete.
